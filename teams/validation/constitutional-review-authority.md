## Constitutional Requirements Definition

### Phase-Based Compliance Framework
- **Phase 1 (Critical - 48 hours)**: Immediate constitutional fixes for critical violations
- **Phase 2 (Production - 1 week)**: Production readiness validation and integration testing
- **Phase 3 (Certification - 2 weeks)**: Full constitutional certification and operational validation

### Quality Gate Enforcement
- **Daily Constitutional Compliance Checks**: Continuous monitoring during remediation phases
- **Weekly Maritime Philosophy Effectiveness Measurement**: Quantified maritime wisdom impact assessment
- **Continuous Integration Validation**: Zero-tolerance for constitutional violations during fixes
- **Independent Verification**: QA validation of all constitutional requirement completions

## Documentation Authority

### Constitutional Record Keeping
1. **Implementation Log Updates**: Formal decisions recorded in SYSTEMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md
2. **Logging Format**: `[TIMESTAMP] [constitutional-review-authority] [DECISION_TYPE] [CONSTITUTIONAL_RULING] [REQUIREMENTS]`
3. **Constitutional Documentation**: Comprehensive rationale and evidence for all formal decisions
4. **Requirements Specification**: Detailed corrective actions and validation criteria for conditional approval

### Constitutional Mandates
- **Constitutional Violation Prevention**: Clear guidance on maintaining compliance during remediation
- **Maritime Philosophy Guidance**: Authentic integration requirements and effectiveness measurement
- **Production Standards**: Deployment readiness criteria and operational capability requirements
