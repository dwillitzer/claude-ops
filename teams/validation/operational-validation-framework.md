## VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

### Daily Constitutional Compliance Validation
```bash
# Every morning (2-3 minutes)
Time: 08:00 daily
Agent: constitutional-compliance-validator
Script: ./scripts/daily-constitutional-check.sh
Template: constitutional-validation-template.md

Validation Requirements:
□ Brutal Honesty Policy adherence (no theater/mocks/placeholders)
□ TDD Mandate compliance (tests written before implementation) 
□ Systems Principle application (components strengthen whole)
□ Atomic Excellence criteria (stable/strong/resilient/flexible/secure)
□ Maritime Philosophy guidance (lighthouse/navigator/constellation wisdom)

Scoring: 5-point daily score → percentage → weekly average
Threshold: >90% weekly constitutional compliance average
Filing: Daily reports in .claude/memory-bank/reports/operational-validation/constitutional/
```

### Weekly Maritime Philosophy Validation
```bash
# Every Friday afternoon (15-20 minutes)
Time: 16:00 weekly  
Agents: lighthouse-operational-validator, navigator-operational-validator, constellation-operational-validator
Scripts: ./scripts/validate-weekly-operations.sh
Templates: lighthouse/navigator/constellation-validation-template.md

Validation Requirements:
LIGHTHOUSE (Decision Guidance):
- Evidence of maritime philosophy guidance in key decisions
- Measurable navigation clarity and chaos prevention
- Authentic wisdom application (not theoretical)

NAVIGATOR (Learning/Memory):
- Systematic learning capture from projects/challenges
- Pattern recognition improvement and application
- Institutional memory development and accessibility

CONSTELLATION (Coordination/Mastery):

```

### Monthly Systematic Excellence Review
