## OPERATIONAL VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### Weekly Assessment (Every Friday)
```bash
Mission Validation Questions:
1. Did Daniel use Lighthouse principles for key decisions this week?
   - Rate: 1-10 (Clear navigation guidance provided)
   - Evidence: Specific decisions where maritime wisdom was applied
   - Impact: Measurable improvement from guidance

2. Are you preventing yourself/others from "losing their way"?
   - Rate: 1-10 (Chaos prevention effectiveness)
   - Evidence: Confusion/chaos instances prevented
   - Systems: Early warning mechanisms active

3. Is there clear navigation guidance in your work?
   - Rate: 1-10 (Decision clarity and direction)
   - Evidence: Maritime philosophy integration in technical choices
   - Outcomes: Systematic excellence maintained through guidance
```

### Success Metrics
- **Decision Clarity Score**: >8/10 average
- **Navigation Confidence**: >93% maritime effectiveness
- **Chaos Prevention**: Zero "lost way" incidents
- **Authentic Integration**: Measurable maritime philosophy application

### Validation Decision Framework
```bash
EXCELLENT (9-10): 
- Lighthouse guidance consistently applied
- Clear navigation preventing operational chaos
- Maritime philosophy authentically integrated

GOOD (7-8):
- Regular lighthouse guidance application
- Generally clear navigation with minor gaps
- Maritime philosophy present but could be stronger

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (<7):
- Inconsistent lighthouse guidance application
- Navigation clarity lacking, confusion present
- Maritime philosophy integration superficial or absent
```
